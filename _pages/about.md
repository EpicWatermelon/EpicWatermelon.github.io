<p align="justify">I am a PhD student at the School of Optometry, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of [Dr. Rachel Ka-Man CHUN](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/so/people/academic-staff/rachel-chun/). My research is focused on the translational application of image processing technology in the field of optometry, with a particular emphasis on employing advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques to support research in children myopia control. My goal is to develop novel methods to assess the efficacy of myopia control strategies, thereby accelerating the transition from laboratory research to clinical practice.</p>
